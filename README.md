# CSS-225-Lab-Projects-Week-6

This repository contains six beginner-friendly Python programs that demonstrate how to use the random and math modules. Each file solves a specific problem using modular programming principles.
- randomrange.py – Prints 10 random integers between 25 and 35.
- randomint.py – Generates a random odd number between 0 and 100.
- randomday.py – Selects a random day of the week.
- pi.py – Approximates π using the Leibniz formula and compares it to math.pi.
- degrees.py – Converts radians to degrees manually and with math.degrees().
- factorial.py – Calculates factorial manually and with math.factorial().

  Skills Practiced
- Using built-in Python modules
- Writing clean, commented code
- Applying loops, user input, and basic math logic
